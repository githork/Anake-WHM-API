NOTE:
Recommend installing this version of Anake WHM API in PHP 5.5+ or higher since in previous versions of php it does not work.

- Remember that you need to have a reseller account at [http://panel.myownfreehost.net](http://panel.myownfreehost.net) to be able to use it through the api.

- Note that you must add the IP address of your hosting in your api reseller otherwise the script will not work and it will give an error, so that you update your ip address.

- This is a simple version with an example of how to use the operation of the api, we recommend working on your web project based on Anake WHM API with the idea of operation.

- The script includes the file index_clean.php where the functions are overmarked with two // so that they have the idea of how to use the available functions.

- In case of having problems with the installation you can do it manually modifying the Client.php file located in: \vendor\hansadema\anake-client\src\Client.php to modify the data of the api.

Well to work on your web project carefully @einet  :)
